		Weal! Today, I celebrated my 18th birthday! Although my birthday was on Friday,
		the celebration ended up being today. Fwed made me my favorite food, KFF!

		It was his first try, though, so a lot of the breading fell off. It still tasted
		good though, so I appreciated it! Next, Fwed and his sisters sang me Happy
		Birthday. The candles were really thin so we didn't have much time!

		Wee-aal! I had a lot of fun! It's good to take some time at major milestones in
		life to celebrate, because you're not going to have a second one again!
