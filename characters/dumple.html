		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
		  Dumple Ling is a special dolphin. He was born when immortal dolphin angels Mummy
		  and Duddy combined the key ingredients of life in their laboratory and infused
		  it with magical power. After 49 days of infusion, the orb of energy suddenly
		  flew away into an enchanted forest.  Mummy and Duddy followed, and soon after
		  there was a brilliant flash of light! Once the light faded, they frantically
		  searched the woods, and finally found the young Dumple, a tiny, bouncy, and
		  pudgy blue dolphin.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Dumple was raised in heaven to become the first mortal dolphin, and when he came
		  of age, he was sent down to the mortal Dolphin World realm to rule the land. As
		  a result, he is venerated by all of dolphinkind as their progenitor.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Dumple is married to Debbie, his childhood friend, and together they had
		  four children: Icee, Skype, Dumpling Junior, and Dorth Vader.
		</p>

		<p>
		  After Dumple's death (from choking on a dumpling), he became a ghost that
		  wandered Dolphin World. Ghosts are supposed to perform good deeds to escape
		  their purgatorical status and ascend to Dolphin Heaven. However, because of
		  Dumple's insatiable appetite, he often became distracted by finding more meat
		  dumplings, so it took him longer than expected to return to heaven, much to his
		  elders' chagrin.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Dumple was then appointed to be the God of Dolphin World, where he served
		  as a powerful yet humorous leader. After his retirement, he spent his days
		  bouncing happily around his old childhood grounds, begging his elders and family
		  for hugs, kisses, meat dumples, and attention.
		</p>

		<p>
		  To keep Dumple busy with work, the Council of Dophin World appointed him the
		  official responsible for many holidays in Dolphin World. Some of his many roles
		  include:

		  <ul>
			<li>God of Wealth (財神), blessing upstanding dolphins with fortune and
			wealth</li>
			<li>Santa Claus, delivering gifts to all of Dolphin World on December 25th
			(ironically, the holiday celebrating Dumple's birthday).</li>
		  </ul>

		<h2>Abilities</h2>
		<p>
		  Dumple's primary elemental power is that of water, being able to generate and
		  manipulate water at will. His parents, uncles, and aunties mistakenly thought
		  he had electricity powers at first, but later it was discovered he actually
		  had the talent of water.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Dumple's other key skill is his bounciness. Due to a mishap in which an
		  enchanted spring fell into the primordial mixture that eventually became Dumple,
		  Dumple became shorter and plumper than usual dolphins, gained a blue coat of
		  fur, and most importantly in incredible bounciness. This skill grants him
		  exceptional defense, as he's able to reflect most attacks without them harming
		  him. He's also able to use it to jump great heights from a stationary start
		  simply by manipulating his bounciness instantaneously.
