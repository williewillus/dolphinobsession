		<h2>Abilities</h2>
		<p>
		  Willie is blessed with the powers of fire, allowing him the use of all sorts of
		  skills to manipulate heat. His favorite move is simply breathing fire through
		  his mouth. It's a versatile attack against any lurking enemies!
		</p>

		<p>
		  It is rumored that Willie's fire powers were granted to him by the first mortal
		  grandmother of all dolphin world, Debbie.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Willie is often seen wearing a loose-fitting sewn bag as clothing. This bag is
		  inhabited by a Willdoll spirit, though Willie just calls it "Bag". Bag is one of
		  Willie's closest confidants, and serves as a defensive layer of armor for him.
