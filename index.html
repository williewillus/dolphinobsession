	  <h2>What is this place?</h2>
	  <p>
		This website is the successor to <i>Dolphin Obsession</i>, a Neopets guild that the
		administrators used to run in their childhood. You may also see the site referred to
		as "Dumple and Friends", which is the handle for our
		<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dumpleandfriends/">Instagram</a>
		and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@dumpleandfriends">Threads</a> accounts.
		
		The goal is to introduce and showcase the many adorable dolphin and other marine
		animals that are part of our family, host their blog posts, and perhaps other fun
		side projects that we think of.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Why does it look like this?</h2>

	  <p>
		This site is built completely manually using HTML, CSS, and minimal amounts of
		JavaScript where necessary. The reason for this is because back in the day of
		Neopets guilds, raw HTML was all we had to use. In an era of bloated webpages and
		megabytes of JavaScript, we hope this site is a refreshing return to a more
		imaginative, innocent, and genuine internet.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Do note that the site administrators are not frontend experts, so the styling of the
		site can be considered to be an eternal work-in-progress.
